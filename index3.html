<center><h1>About Me</h1></center> 
<center><p>I was born on December 5th, 1998 in Good Samaritan Hospital which is only 10 minutes away from the house i've lived
in my entire life</p><center>
<center><p>When I graduate college the thing i'd like to do most is work in a company located in Scotland or London</p></center>
<center><h2><font size="5">Hometown</font></h2></center>

<center><p>I grew up in a small town called pearl river, about 30 minutes outside of New York city</p></center>

<center><p>It was a cute little town with a small village in the middle of it where I spent most of my childhood</p></center>

<center><p>Although I lived in Pearl River I went to school in the town over, Nanuet, because of the school borders</p></center>

<center><p>There was a surplus of shops and restaurants in the area around my town so there was always something to do</p></center>

<center><p>One of the highlights would definitely be the palisades mall

<center><h3><font size="5">Activities</font></h3><center>

<center><p>I played field hockey from 7th grade until my senior year</p></center>

<center><p>I ran track for most seasons of high school; I did not go 
out for the team every season because it was a love/hate relationship</p></center>

<center><p>I tried golf for one season only to find out I was terrible </p></center>

<center><p>I worked at an Irish restaurant called Daveys Locker from freshman 
year of high school till summer going into freshman year of college </p></center>

<center><h4><font size="5">My Family</font></h4><center>
<center><p>My immediate family consists of my mother, my father, my brother and my fathers fiance</p><center>
<center><p>Most of my extended family either lives in Scotland or Canada</p><center>
<center><p>I only have a few relatives that live in the United States and that is because my mother was born in Scotland and my Fathers 
family is from Canada</p></center>
<center><p>I only have one pet and that is my dog Ollie, he is a 6 year old yorkshire terrier</p></center>
